**Laura L \- General Background**

Technology today is moving faster than ever, and it’s changing the way we live, work, and even power our communities. Instead of just building bigger and bigger centralized systems, a lot of the focus now is on smaller, smarter, and more local solutions especially in energy. One of the clearest examples of this shift is the rise of microgrids. Microgrids are small, independent energy systems that can either work with the main grid or on their own. They're becoming more important because our traditional energy grids are often too old, too centralized, and not ready for the kind of extreme weather events we’re seeing more often.

That's why we are going to talk about how a lot of universities in the U.S. have already been early adopters of microgrid technology. Schools like the University of Texas at Austin, New York University, Cornell, Princeton, and Santa Rosa Junior College have built their own microgrids to make sure they can keep running even when the main power grid fails. 

## **What Exists Right Now**

Today’s microgrids aren’t just simple backup generators, they're complex, well-designed systems that combine different technologies. Many use solar panels, wind turbines, batteries for storage, fuel cells, and even advanced smart meters. Some stay connected to the bigger grid most of the time but can automatically go themselves if the main grid goes down. Others are built to be completely independent from the start

For example, Santa Rosa Junior College (SRJC) has a microgrid powered by solar panels and batteries that lets their Petaluma campus stay open during California’s wildfire blackouts. UT Austin runs one of the biggest and most successful university microgrids in the country; it powered the whole campus during Winter Storm Uri while the rest of the city lost power. Then there’s the Bronx Zoo, which built a microgrid to protect its animals during outages using solar panels, fuel cells, and battery storage.

Beyond universities and zoos, microgrids are popping up everywhere: hospitals, military bases, airports, neighborhoods, and even remote villages that never had stable electricity before. They're even being studied for use in ships, space missions, and water treatment plants.

## **How Technology Progressed**

Microgrids have come a long way. In the past, small, local power systems were mostly used for very remote areas without any grid access. They were simple, usually diesel generators, and not very environmentally friendly. But today, thanks to huge leaps in renewable energy (like better solar panels), cheaper and more powerful batteries, and smarter control systems, microgrids can be clean, reliable, and efficient.

One big change has been how microgrids are controlled. Old systems needed everything to go through a central controller, which could be a single point of failure. Now, a lot of microgrids use distributed control, where different parts of the system work together and adjust on their own, making the whole thing stronger and more flexible.

## **Why It’s Useful**

The main reason why microgrids are so useful is simple: they keep the lights on when everything else fails. During Winter Storm Uri, UT Austin’s microgrid didn’t just power classrooms  it kept hospitals running and kept students warm. In California, SRJC’s microgrid turned the campus into a shelter during wildfires and power shutoffs. The Bronx Zoo’s microgrid helped protect animal life-support systems during outages.

But reliability isn’t the only benefit. Microgrids also:

* **Promote clean energy**: Many microgrids use renewable sources like solar and wind, reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

* **Save money**: Over time, microgrids can lower energy costs, especially for big campuses or hospitals.

* **Support communities**: During emergencies, places with microgrids can stay open and provide essential services.

* **Educate and inspire**: Schools with microgrids can train the next generation of engineers, technicians, and policy makers.

Of course, microgrids aren’t perfect. Studies have shown that if not carefully designed, microgrids could actually increase local air pollution, especially if they rely too much on fossil fuels or have limited battery storage. Some systems, like the Bronx Zoo’s, struggled with maintenance issues and not having enough battery backup during longer outages.

At the end of the day, the message is pretty clear: microgrids are a smarter, safer way to keep critical places powered. They’re flexible, they can run on clean energy, and they give communities more control over their own energy future. Especially in places like Texas, where climate factors like: storms, heat waves, and an aging grid are real problems, microgrids could be a huge part of the answer.

**David V \- 3 Case studies (in energy and sustainability)** 

Texas’s power grid has had some tough moments in the last few years. From Winter Storm Uri to record-breaking heat waves, the current system can’t always keep up. That’s where **microgrids** come in. Microgrids are small, local power systems that can run on their own, even if the main grid fails. This report looks at three real-world case studies that show the strengths and weaknesses of microgrids, especially those using **green energy**. We highlight Santa Rosa Junior College (SRJC), the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin), and the Bronx Zoo in New York City. Each example gives valuable insights that Texas can use as it builds a more resilient, sustainable grid.

### **Case Study 1: SRJC Microgrid (Santa Rosa Junior College, California)**

**Overview:**  
 SRJC built a solar-powered microgrid on its Petaluma campus to stay open during wildfire season and statewide blackouts. It uses solar panels, battery storage, and smart controls.

**Why It Worked Well:**

* **Emergency Resilience:** When PG\&E shut down power during fire threats, SRJC’s campus stayed open as a safe place for students and staff.

* **Green Power:** The solar panels and batteries make the school cleaner and more energy-independent.

* **Education and Outreach:** Students learn about renewable energy systems, and the campus serves as a model for others.

**What Texas Can Learn:**  
 This microgrid is perfect for rural or semi-rural areas in Texas where the power grid might fail during storms or wildfires. Schools, libraries, or city halls could be powered this way to serve the community in emergencies. [**SRJC Micro-Grid | Sustainability**](https://sustainability.santarosa.edu/srjc-micro-grid)

### **Case Study 2: UT Austin Microgrid (University of Texas at Austin, Texas)**

**Overview:**  
 UT Austin runs a self-contained, utility-grade energy system that powers its entire campus. It includes a **Combined Heat and Power (CHP)** plant, chilled water systems, solar panels, and smart meters. Though it started with natural gas, it’s now one of the **greenest microgrids in the U.S.**

**Why It’s So Successful and Green:**

* **Zero Unplanned Outages:** Even during 2021’s Winter Storm Uri, the UT microgrid stayed online, providing heating, power, and water when the rest of the city went dark.

* **Green Energy Push:** UT’s system now includes rooftop solar panels and thermal storage that lowers greenhouse gas emissions. The university has committed to carbon neutrality and is phasing in more renewables each year.

* **Efficient Design:** The microgrid captures waste heat from electricity generation and reuses it for heating water and buildings, which saves money and cuts emissions.

**What Texas Can Learn:**  
 UT Austin proves that even big systems can be sustainable and resilient. Large hospitals, city campuses, and even industrial parks in Texas could follow this example—combining solar, battery storage, and smart energy reuse to stay green and secure.

### **Case Study 3: Bronx Zoo Microgrid (New York City, New York)**

**Overview:**  
 The Bronx Zoo installed a green microgrid with **solar panels, batteries, and fuel cells** to lower its carbon footprint and keep power running for sensitive animal habitats. The idea was to make the zoo more energy-efficient and eco-friendly.

**What Went Right:**

* **Green Innovation:** The zoo used clean energy sources to reduce its impact on the environment, which fit its conservation mission.

* **Energy Cost Savings:** Solar and fuel cells helped lower utility bills and reduce reliance on the New York City grid.

* **Backup Power for Critical Systems:** The zoo kept animal habitats and life-support systems running during power outages.

**What Went Wrong:**

* **Not Enough Storage:** Battery limits meant that power only lasted for a few hours during longer blackouts.

* **High Maintenance Needs:** Some of the equipment, like the fuel cells, required frequent maintenance and skilled staff.

* **Public Misunderstanding:** The zoo was seen as fully self-powered, but it still relied heavily on the main grid during peak use.

**What Texas Can Learn:**  
 Even when microgrids use clean energy, they can fall short without enough battery storage or backup systems. Texas should focus on **balancing green tech with reliability**—especially in places like zoos, aquariums, or research centers that can’t afford to lose power.[**Bronx Zoo & Con Edison Team Up on Green Energ**](https://www.amny.com/sponsored/con-edison-and-bronx-zoos-waste-heat-project/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)**[Bronx Zoo’s energy overhaul promises nearly $500K in annual cost savings, NYC officials say | Facilities Dive](https://www.facilitiesdive.com/news/bronx-zoos-energy-overhaul-promises-nearly-500k-in-annual-cost-savings-n/716823/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)**

### **Comparison Table**

| Category | SRJC | UT Austin | Bronx Zoo |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Main Energy Sources | Solar \+ batteries | CHP \+ solar \+ thermal storage | Solar \+ batteries \+ fuel cells |
| Emergency Reliability | High during wildfires and shutoffs | Extremely high, survived Winter Storm Uri | Moderate – worked for short outages |
| Environmental Impact | Low emissions, clean energy | High efficiency \+ carbon reduction goals | Clean energy, but limited scale |
| Community Benefit | Shelter \+ education center | Student training \+ power for hospitals | Backup for animal care, less public use |
| Cost & Maintenance | Affordable and practical | Efficient long-term investment | Expensive upkeep for fuel cells |

### **Key Lessons and Recommendations for Texas:**

1. **Mix Green with Reliable Tech:** Clean energy is the goal, but battery storage and backup generation are key for keeping power on when it really counts.

2. **Design for Real Emergencies:** Whether it's a snowstorm or a heatwave, systems need to be tested under tough conditions—like UT Austin did.

3. **Focus on Public Spaces:** Schools, shelters, hospitals, and public buildings should be the first to get microgrids. They help people the most in a crisis.

4. **Make Systems Easy to Run:** Bronx Zoo’s issues show how hard-to-maintain systems can be a problem. Simple, smart designs are better for most Texas communities.

5. **Don’t Just Build—Educate:** SRJC and UT Austin both use their microgrids to tsame.

Overall, Texas has the chance to lead the way in reliable, sustainable energy with microgrids. SRJC’s simple solar setup, UT Austin’s high-tech and green powerhouse, and the Bronx Zoo’s creative but challenging system all offer valuable lessons. The future isn’t just about surviving the next storm—it’s about building energy systems that protect people, save money, and care for the environment. With the right plan, ABB Group and the TRC can help bring these kinds of smart energy systems to communities all across Texas.

Collin Trevino: Information on UH Central plant and transition into Microgrid proposal

The central plant at the University of Houston is a pivotal facility in ensuring the campus is operational. The facility is responsible for distributing essential utilities throughout the campus, such as electricity, chilled water, and steam. Without the central plant the infrastructure of the campus would collapse. The central plant is positioned in the heart of UH, and it allows for the seamless operation of almost every building on campus through the use of underground tunnels. This is the main reason why there are no transmission lines on campus.  

In totality, the central plant generates approximately 18,000 tons of chilled water per hour and consumes around 33,000 kilowatts of electricity. Although all of the electricity is supplied through the external grid of Texas: Electric reliability council of Texas (ERCOT) the plant handles all internal distribution across the campus. As stated previously, this is done through a feeding system of underground tunnels that are approximately three miles long, eight feet height and twelve feet wide. Without the central plant the campus and many of its major buildings would cease to function. Over the years expansions have been made to the plant to increase capacity and efficiency. Around 8,000 square feet of operational space has been added and with it the total number of chillers, boilers, and cooling towers have also increased.  

The goal of the plant was to create an environment on campus that is sustainable and operationally resilient. To assist with this, the central plant is equipped with 88 rooftop solar panels which generate electricity for all of the low-voltage equipment throughout the building. Furthermore, UH has continued to push for developments in energy conservation through the use of automated systems that can easily balance energy usage across the campus. Overall, this goal is still nowhere near too complete, and the university will continue to strive to be 100% self-sufficient. It is understood that Texas experiences severe weather conditions often and during the late 2022 winter freeze the Central Plant remained fully operational despite severe weather conditions. However, staff members had to work extended shifts between 14-24 hours long just to maintain service throughout the campus. This event reflects the importance of the central plant but also the need to make it more operationally friendly and self-sustaining. The solution to these problems lies in the generation of electricity on campus.  

The potential for UH to become a Micro-grid and generate its own electricity is extremely high. Solar panels have been proven to work not only on site but through other campuses located in Texas such as Texas A\&M and UT Austin. However, UH also has the option to use the system they already have in place to create a *Combined heat and Power* (CHP) system. A CHP system utilizes turbines integrated into the steam and chilled water production / distribution system UH already has. By using the turbines in conjunction with the movement of steam / water electricity can be generated. The introduction of a CHP system allows UH to become a self-contained microgrid that generates almost all of its electrical needs. This would create a more efficient energy system and would increase resiliency even further. In the long term this would save the university millions of dollars but does require a high upfront cost of investment. Additionally, the push to become a microgrid would mean having to face the same regulatory hurdles for energy generation outside of ERCOT. Despite these barriers, UH's size, current thermal infrastructure, and commitment to sustainability make it a strong candidate for successful CHP integration and microgridD development. Investing in this future would not only protect the campus from electrical grid disruptions but also align with broader environmental and economic goals. With the necessary planning and funding, the Central Plant has the potential to become a model for sustainable, independent campus energy systems in higher education and could be used elsewhere across the nation.

David Do: Microgrid Proposal for UH  
Microgrids are small energy grids that are capable of either operating independently or in conjunction with the larger power grid. Microgrids generally consist of several different sources of energy, such as solar panels, gas generators, and batteries, to provide stable electricity that is also highly reliable. Over the past decade, universities have continued to research microgrid installation to assess energy security, reduce their carbon footprint, and support campus sustainability initiatives. In the case of the University of Houston, a microgrid plan could be assessed and adopted with influence from their neighboring university, Rice University, which operates on its own power plants to sustain their campus.

Rice University's microgrid consists mainly of a natural gas combined heat and power (CHP) plant, solar panels, and energy storage technologies. The CHP plant can meet 100% of the heating needs of the campus while meeting up to 60% of the electrical needs (Rice University Facilities Engineering and Planning, 2023). Furthermore, during extreme weather events such as Winter Storm Uri in 2021, Rice's microgrid kept the campus powered, while most of Houston was suffering from power outages. Important benefits provided by the Rice microgrid include better energy resilience, significant savings on energy costs, and lower carbon emissions. The University of Houston is currently dependent on the wider grid provided by CenterPoint Energy, which impacts energy resilience during outages from hurricanes or severe weather events. The University of Houston has undertaken small amounts of sustainability work through solar projects and energy efficiency work but has not yet planned the development of an integrated microgrid capable of sustaining operations independently during emergencies.

A hypothetical microgrid for UH could consist of several components: 

* Solar: Rooftop solar panels and solar shade structures over parking lots with an average solar irradiance of approximately 4.7 kWh/m²/day (National Renewable Energy Laboratory \[NREL\], 2022\) makes solar attractive.   
* Natural Gas CHP: A gas-powered Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant that could generate electricity and thermal energy simultaneously for campus buildings.   
* Battery Storage: Lithium-ion batteries can store excess energy and provide backup during outages.  
* Microgrid Control Models: Smart inverters, load management, and demand response could make sure the energy is consumed in only the most efficient and resilient ways. 

The University of Houston spans approximately 894 acres and serves over 46,000 students, faculty, and staff. Based on typical university campus consumption, UH uses around 150,000 to 200,000 MWh of electricity annually (U.S. Department of Energy, 2016). A microgrid would need to match a significant portion of this demand. Solar energy could supply a meaningful fraction of UH's load. If even 20% of rooftop space across campus buildings and parking structures were utilized, preliminary estimates suggest solar installations could provide up to 10-15 MW of capacity. Battery storage systems would be essential to manage intermittency and critical loads during grid outages. A CHP plant sized around 10-15 MW could further supplement the grid, particularly for essential services such as dormitories, research labs, and food services.  
The upfront capital cost for a microgrid installation at the University of Houston would be large as it would require investment in infrastructure and material. Depending on the system size and the technology people select, costs would likely be in the range of $20 million to $50 million (Navigant Research, 2019). However, the anticipated cost of electricity, reductions in demand charges, and avoided costs of outages would help offset costs to some degree and would offset costs after some amount of time. However, funding could be invested through programs and initiatives such as: Federal and state grants, such as FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Assistance Program, investment tax credits for solar and battery systems, and energy savings performance contracts (ESPCs) with commercial partners. In comparison, Rice University reportedly saves approximately $2 million each year since the installation of their microgrid (Rice University Facilities, 2023).

The installation of a microgrid on the University of Houston campus would have an important environmental and social impact in several ways. First, when a part of UH's energy supply comes from on-site renewables like solar and more efficient combined heat and power (CHP) plants, it will decrease the amount of carbon emissions produced by the university. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (2023), CHP facilities achieve efficiencies of approximately 80 percent when compared to about 50 percent for traditional heat and power generation. Such improvement would help provide data in support of the university's sustainability goals and enhance its positive reputation as a conservation leader. A microgrid would also improve social impacts by providing direct opportunities for students to learn and conduct research on the university's campus when they work with a microgrid. A microgrid and its capabilities would be useful during extreme weather situations and during utility outages. During hairy weather situations, the UH campus may serve as an emergency shelter for communities in Houston providing sustainable energy, food, and possibly help with medical care; similar to what Rice University's microgrid demonstrated during Winter Storm Uri (Microgrid Knowledge, 2021).

However, there are many challenges and risks of moving to a microgrid level at UH. The primary challenge and risk involves the degree of initial capital investment. The development of a fully operational campus microgrid can take tens of millions of dollars, depending on the generation mix, storage capacity and control technologies involved (U.S. Department of Energy, 2022). While there are federal and state grants and other forms of funding for microgrid development, financing would require diligent planning, most likely public private partnerships, and probably in phases. Regulatory challenges also provide challenges. Since UH is currently connected to CenterPoint Energy and continues to operate in ERCOT's grid, any microgrid implementation would require negotiations to allow the microgrid to island (disconnect) during outages without violating state prohibitions. Maintenance challenges are also an issue since microgrids involve continuous management to obtain best performance. Without a dedicated operational team there is risk of faulty systems going unnoticed, or accruing costs for repairs. Finally, there are technology risks to consider. Cyber security for microgrid operational control systems is a significant technology risk to consider (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 2022).

**Funding Microgrids:**

We all know that building and operating microgrids is not cheap, but there are multiple funding pathways that exist today to make them possible. Funding typically comes from a combination of:

\-   	Federal grants, like the U.S. Department of Energy’s Microgrid Initiative.

\-   	State level programs, like the Texas Energy Reliability Program.

\-   	Utility partnership, in this case is where the local energy providers helps fund microgrids to reduce the grids stress load.

\-   	Private investors

\-   	University and institutional funding that often comes from sustainability budgets or research grants

From these ways of funding, a major source is the U.S. Department of Energy that do it through programs such as the Office of Electricity’s Microgrid Program. This program offers grants for the development and demonstration of microgrid systems. This is a good way for universities to get this funding by proposing pilot projects that emphasize research in renewable energy and work on the community’s resilience of the grid. Additionally, to this, there are other programs like the Grid Deployment Office and the Inflation Reduction Act that offer tax credits for renewable energy initiatives.

On the state level, Texas is exploring the implementation of microgrids in its grid, especially after the devastating impacts of the 2021 Winter Storm Uri. There are some proposed polices such as the Texas Microgrid and Resiliency Act that would create grant funding pools that would support microgrids infrastructure in hospitals, universities and municipal buildings. There is also the Texas Energy Reliability Program that also has the potential to finance microgrids that enhance grid stability during peak demand or natural disasters.

**What could UH actually do?**

At the University of Houston, the simplest and most immediate step would be to start with a pilot microgrid project. One interesting way to approach this would be to install a solar-plus-battery microgrid system in a strategic location like the Universities Technology bridge since is one of the universities smaller campuses. This technology could serve as a test for the implementation of this systems. As already said, a project like this could be financed using federal grants, and this could also have positive outcomes for students since it would create new academic and research opportunities. UH could integrate microgrid management into its engineering and energy research programs that would position the university as a leader in sustainable campus design like its competition UT Austin that uses internal capital investments to finance their microgrid. It is important to focus first on the critical loads like the essential facilities or the student housing if we want to maximize early benefits to the community. For example, a microgrid powering a whole dormitory building or the library could ensure the students safety and comfort during extreme weather events like hurricanes or blackouts.

 

**How to have more impact at state and federal level?**

It is important to think about the impact that microgrids could have outside of UH campus, and for that it is crucial to engage at both the state and federal policy levels. At the state level, we think UH could join with other Texas universities to advocate for an increased in funding for microgrid projects through the Texas Legislature. The school could support initiatives that promote microgrid infrastructure that’s important to disaster response. At the federal level, UH should ask for funding from the Grid Resilience Innovation Partnership Program, that was created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and advocates for the continuation and expansion of microgrids, the grid deployment office is administering a $10.5 billion to enhance grid flexibility and improve the resilience of the power system against extreme weather. Finally, another thing that the University of Houston can do it to establish itself as a resiliency hub within the Resilient Houston Plan, in that way we could partner with the city to develop university linked microgrids that also help the surrounding communities during disasters. We think that UH’s urban location and energy expertise make it a good leader to improve the campus resilience and help the communities needs.

**Policies proposed to improve microgrid incentives:**

There are several key policies that are either already in motion or proposed that will help microgrid development:

\-   	Inflation Reduction Act: This provides new tax credits for microgrids, battery storage and renewable energy generation components. This act helps to lower the cost of microgrids.

\-   	DOE Microgrid Program: This offers grant for universities and public entities to pilot microgrid designs that emphasize reliability and clean energy usage.

\-   	Texas Energy Reliability Program: This program will provide grants to Texas electric  utilities and power generators outside of the ERCOT region to operate, expansions are being considered to fund distributed energy resilience projects and could potentially include microgrids.

If these initiatives succeed, microgrids will become much more affordable and it would accelerate the implementation of them across universities, hospitals and municipalities. However, the continued advocacy is very important to ensure that microgrids continue to improve and to receive strong financial and policy support.
